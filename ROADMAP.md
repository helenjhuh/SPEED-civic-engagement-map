# Civic Engagement Roadmap

# v0.x
* Display a project's pins on the map when it is selected
* Provide user feedback when they delete a project
* Reimplement single project page
* Reimplement form validations
* Continue to split up react components / pages
* Projects on the home page should be pulled from verified projects list
* Projects on the home page should link to single project page
* Projects should be categorized -- We currently do not have categories for a drop down list
  while creating a project. Can we come up with a list of categories for this?
* When the application is run for the first time, and there are no users or roles in the system, the server
  needs to generate an admin role and an admin user.

# v1.0.0
* User management for administrators
* Role management for administrators
* Project verification by administrators
